## Standard RAG
### **Overview**
Standard RAG is a robust framework optimized for **text-based document retrieval**. It provides secure, cost-effective, and scalable pipelines tailored for scientific and technical use cases. Key features include support for **Ollama** and **OpenAI** models, integration with **Chroma DB** and **Pinecone**, and advanced embedding techniques.

### **Key Features**
1. **Secure and Cost-Effective Pipelines**:
   - Chroma DB-based pipelines with **Ollama** models for on-device inference.
   - Pinecone-based pipelines for cloud-based solutions.
   - Advanced embedding techniques like **BGE** and **OpenAI embeddings**.

2. **Flexible Model Support**:
   - **Ollama Models**: deepseek-r1:14b, llama3.2-vision.
   - **OpenAI Models**: GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo.

3. **Pipeline Selection Guide**:
   - **High Security**: Chroma DB + BGE Embedding + Ollama.
   - **Cost-Effective**: Chroma DB + OAI text-embedding-3-small + Ollama.
   - **High Precision**: Chroma DB + BGE Embedding + OpenAI.
   - **Cloud-Based**: Pinecone + OpenAI text-embedding-3-small.

4. **Research Findings**:
   - **CharacterTextSplitter (CTS)** outperforms RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (RCTS) in reducing hallucinations and preserving context.
   - **BGE Embeddings** provide tighter clustering and consistency compared to OpenAI embeddings.

## Multimodal RAG
### **Overview**
Multimodal RAG extends the capabilities of Standard RAG by supporting **multimodal data retrieval**, including **text, tables, and images**. It is specifically designed for **polymer science** and other domain-specific applications, offering advanced data extraction, intelligent chunking, and specialized analysis.

### **Key Features**
1. **Advanced Data Extraction**:
   - Extracts text, tables, and images from PDF documents.
   - Preserves table structure with HTML formatting.
   - Handles complex scientific notation and equations.

2. **Intelligent Chunking Strategy**:
   - Divides content by section headings.
   - Configurable chunk sizes (default: max 10,000 characters).
   - Smart text combination for small segments (<2,000 characters).

3. **Specialized Analysis**:
   - Rheological analysis with **HMMSF model** support.
   - Preservation of key terms like **extensional viscosity** and **shear thinning**.
   - Tracks quantitative relationships (e.g., η vs γ̇, Trouton ratios).

4. **Multimodal Retrieval & Summarization**:
   - Batch processing with progress tracking.
   - Parallel processing of different content types.
   - Specialized prompts for rheological data interpretation.
